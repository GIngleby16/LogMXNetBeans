OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    The plugin allows LogMX (log analyzer tool) to communicate with a NetBeans plugin in order to open Java source files directly from LogMX: when LogMX detects a Java stack trace in a log entry, it creates a link for each stack trace line so that when this link is clicked, running instance of the IDE open the corresponding stack trace Java element at the right line.  \
    Also simply hovering this link with the mouse will show the source directly from LogMX thanks to the NetBeans plugin.\n\n\
