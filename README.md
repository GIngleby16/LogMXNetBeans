## What is Log MX?

LogMX is an intuitive and cross-platform tool, for developers and administrators analyzing log files. 

Using a nice and powerful graphical interface, LogMX parses, displays and monitors any logs from any source.


The LogMX NetBeans Plugin integrates LogMX & NetBeans.

When viewing a stack trace in LogMX you can view the related source code 
(passed from the NetBeans IDE) or you can click on the stack trace entry to open
the corresponding file in your NetBeans workspace at the line the error occurred!
